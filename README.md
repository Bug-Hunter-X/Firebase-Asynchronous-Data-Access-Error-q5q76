This repository demonstrates a common Firebase error: accessing document data before it is fully loaded. The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to read data from a Firebase document snapshot prematurely. This leads to errors if the data hasn't finished loading. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that uses asynchronous operations correctly and handles potential errors.
